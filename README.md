Websockets Project README
Author: Ben Connick

This is a browser-based multiplayer roguelike where players all share one big screen and use their smartphone as a controller.


old_server.js is the old ES5 server, which is only around for posterity. 
Currently the project deploys using src/server.js

In the "public" directory are the old ES5 client scripts. These will be updated to ES6 for the final.

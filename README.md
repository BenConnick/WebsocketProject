Author: Ben Connick

Contents:
This is a browser-based multiplayer roguelike where players all share one big screen and use their smartphones as a controllers.


old_server.js is the old ES5 server, which is only around for posterity. 
Currently the project deploys using src/server.js

In the "public" directory are the client scripts. 
They have been updated to ES6, but they do not pass the AirBnB styleguide check.
